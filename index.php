        <h2>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h2>

        <h4>Summer 2014</h4>
        <p>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence is a three-credit undergraduate course emphasizing the building of agents, environments, and systems that can be considered as acting intelligently. In particular, you will learn about the methods and tools that will allow you to build complete systems that can interact intelligently with their environment by learning and reasoning about the world.</p>
        <h4>Instructor</h4>
        <p>Pushkar Kolhe<br />271A, College of Computing Building</p>
        <p>Office Hours: TBD</p>
        <p>Contact: pushkar@cc.gatech.edu</p>
        <h4>Lectures</h4>
        <p>CCB 102 Tue, Thur 10-11:45 am</p>
        <h4>Objectives</h4>
        <p>These are the primary objectives of this course:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To learn how to think like a data scientist.</li>
          <li>To build intelligent applications that analyze and predict data.</li>
          <li>To develop the basic skills necessary to pursue research in ML.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Almost all of Machine Learning applications today require you to think like a researcher. So the last objective will be the core of this course.</p>
        <h4>Prerequisities</h4>
        <p>Someone once said that the trick to doing AI is coming up with a good representation. That's not quite all there is to it, but it's close enough, so to succeed at this class, you should know a bit about data structures and algorithms. At the very least, you will have to be able to read pseudocode and understand basic algorithms as they are presented to you.</p>
        <p>Someone else one defined AI as finding fast algorithms for NP-hard problems. Again, that's not quite all there is to it, but it's not too far from the truth, so it also turns out that a familiarity with (or at least a lack of abject fear over) some basic theory helps to situate many of the algorithms.</p>
        <p>As the semester continues, it turns out that a familiarity with basic probability theory will also be very useful; however, we will spend some time on that in class in order to refresh your memory. Finally, you should feel pretty comfortable programming on your own. All projects will be implemented in Python. We will spend no time explaining languages in class; at this point in your career you've been exposed to several programming language and are expected to be able to readily acquire new programming language skills.</p>
        <h4><a href="reading.php">Course Materials</a></h4>

        <h4>Grading</h4>
        <p>Your grade will be divided into four components: assignments, a group project, midterm and final exam.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Assignments:</b> You will have three assignments which will help you to understand how each algorithm that we learn can assist you to analyze data. The last assignment will be on Kaggle where you will compete with your classmates on a data challenge.</li>
        <li><b>Midterm and Final Exam:</b> These will be closed book exams.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Numbers</b>:
        <br />Assignments 50%
        <br />Midterm 25%
        <br />Final 25%</p>
        <h4>Statement of Academic Honesty</h4>
        <p>Your aim should not be to ace the course, but learn as much as you can. Be honest in solving your assignments and exams and you will learn and enjoy the material. You are all adults, more or less, and are expected to follow the university's code of academic conduct (you know, <a href="http://www.gatech.edu/honor/">the honor code</a>). Furthermore, at least some of you are researchers-in-training, and I expect that you understand proper attribution and the importance of intellectual honesty. I also have several... friends... from Texas who will help me personally deal with you.</p>
        <h4>Due Dates</h4>
        <p>All graded assignments are due by the time and date indicated. I will not accept late assignments or make up exams. You will get zero credit for any late assignment. If a meteor landed on your bed and destroyed your assignment, I need a signed note from the meteor. You should also treat assigned readings as, well, assignments that are due at the beginning of each class.</p>
